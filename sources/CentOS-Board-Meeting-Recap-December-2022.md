CentOS Board Meeting Recap, December 2022
======

The recording of the December CentOS Board meeting is finally available after some holiday delays.

- [Watch the recording][1]
- [Read the minutes][2]

The recording has timestamps so you can skip to the parts that interest you. Here are a few highlights of the meeting:

- [Issue 85][3]: The Board likes the vision statement written by Pat Riehecky. It will be sent to the centos-devel mailing list and adopted if there are no objections.
- [CentOS Connect][4] is February 3 in Brussels, the day before FOSDEM. Amy Marrich reminded people to submit talk proposals, but as of this blog post, the accepted talks and full schedule have already been announced.
- [Issue 90][5]: There was a discussion about account names for SIG to publish images on Quay. Discussion is ongoing on the issue. The Hyperscale SIG has adopted an account naming strategy for various services, which we may use as a recommendation for other SIGs.

The next board meeting is Janurary 11 at 21:00 UTC, which is already tomorrow as of the publishing of this blog post. You can find details on the centos-devel mailing list.
