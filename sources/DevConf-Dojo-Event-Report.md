我们于 8 月 17 日在波士顿大学举行了 CentOS 布道。该布道与 DevConf.US 位于同一地点。这是自疫情以来我们的第一次面对面活动，我们试图邀请远程参与者。除了直播以外，我们还转发了远程参与者的问题。现场录音可在 YouTube 上找到。

我们有两个时长的会谈版本：40 分钟时长和 20 分钟时长。 这在一般情况下效果很好，但我们未来应该考虑调整时长。 除了一个意外，从 41 分钟到 51 分钟冗长的谈话全部结束了。（我们
故意将意外放在最后，因为我们无法预估时长）短时长的版本是双向的，从 16 分钟到 24 分钟不等。在简短的谈话中间有 10 分钟的间隔时间，而长时的谈话则有5分钟间隔时间。 我这样做只是为了让所有东西都排成每行一刻钟。 这可以在后续使用中调整。 我们做到了，但是，设法按时完成。

我们使用了波士顿大学乔治谢尔曼工会的露台休息室。这个房间非常符合我们的需要。 它是一个50人教室，并且有一个小的入口走廊。人们可以在不打扰谈话的情况下享用咖啡和零食，并且它通向一个户外露台，人们可以在那里呼吸新鲜空气。

We had optional (but strongly recommended) registration for in-person
attendance, and we didn't check registrations at the door, so we don't
know exactly how many people attended or how many walk-ins there were.
I did periodic counts throughout the day. We usually had 20 to 25
people in the room, and probably had around 30 total people. Online
participation had around 20 total people, with 10 to 15 online at any
given time. We did a quick survey for online participants to get
stickers mailed. That survey had 11 respondents.

The A/V setup was great. The HDMI feed from presenters' laptops was fed
into a splitter so it appeared on-screen and was available for the live
stream. There was a nice camera at the back of the room. The video
feeds from the camera and the presenter were fed into a simple HDMI
switch, which then gave us HDMI to plug into the streaming laptop. This
allowed us to switch between a room view and the slides. Boston
University provided us a laptop to use for streaming, but I used my
personal laptop because I already had it logged into the right
accounts. The audio from the presenters' mics was also added to the
HDMI for the live stream. We should try to replicate this setup at
future events, even if other venues don't provide all the equipment for
us.

We streamed on YouTube. This was extremely easy to set up, easy to
promote, and easy for people to join. I feel like it worked very well.
However, there was a suggestion to use Hopin in the future. We've used
Hopin for our all-virtual Dojos, and one of the nice things about it is
that it gives remote participants a virtual hallway track where they
can video chat, which is something we definitely lacked with the
YouTube stream. On the other hand, a Hopin event requires more setup,
and participants have to register. We should give serious thought to
our streaming platform next time.

I'm overall very happy with the turnout, with the high quality of the
talks, and with the audience engagement.
